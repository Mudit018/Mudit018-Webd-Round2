## Information About API

### API
> An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and
tools for building software applications.

> Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact.
Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI)
components.

> A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the
building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.




For making this project, I have used [Sportsmonk API](https://www.sportmonks.com/) to get information about players, matches and club names in various leagues.

One can use this API by visiting their site either by clicking above or by clicking on this link: https://www.sportmonks.com/
